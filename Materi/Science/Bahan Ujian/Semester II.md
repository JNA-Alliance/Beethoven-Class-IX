**Definitions**
- Electronic Structure: **The arrangement of electrons in the shells around the nucleus of an atom**.
- Shells: **Electronic shells are layers around the nucleus of an atom where the electrons are arranged; the electrons move about within their shells**.
- Orbit: **Electronic orbits are the paths followed by electrons around the nucleus of an atom**.
- Proton: **Positively charged particles found inside the nucleus of an atom**.
- Neutron: **Particles found in the nucleus of an atom that have no electronic charge**.
- Electron: **A negatively charged particle found surounding the nucleus of an atom**.
- Nucleus (Atom): **The centre of an atom formed from protons and neutrons**.
- Counting Proton, Neutron, and Electrons
  - Atomic number: **Number of Protons; Equal to number of Electrons**.
  - Mass number: **Protons + Neutrons**
  - Calculate Neutrons: **Mass Number - Atomic Number**
- Exothermic reaction: **A chemical reaction in which energy is given out into the environment**.
- Endothermic reaction: **A checmical reaction in which energy is taken in from the environment**.

**Trivia**
- Group 1 is also known as **alkali metals**.
- Group 8 is also known as **noble gases**.
- Group 7 is also known as **halongens**.
- Properties of the element in Group 8: **Gas, Stable**
- Combustion need: **Fuel, Air, and Heat**
- Example of
  - Exothermic reaction: **Charcoal burns, Combustion of Hydrogen, Burning of Magnesium, Oxidation, Magnesium and Hydrochloric acid**
  - Endothermic reaction: **Melting ice, Sodium hydrogencarbonate + citric acid -> Sodium citrate + water**
- Word equation for:
  - Magnesium + Hydrochloric acid -> **Magnesium chloride + Hydrogen + Heat**
- An example of a chemical reaction where heat is given out **Magnesium ribbon placed in hydrocloric acid**
- An example of an endothermic **REACTION**: **Sodium hydrogencarbonate added to citric acid**
- An example of an endothermic **PROCESS**: **Melting ice**
- The type of reaction between calcium and water: **Exothermic**
