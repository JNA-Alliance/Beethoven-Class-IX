### Definitions
- CFC (Chlorofluorocarbons): **A gas that could damage the ozone layer. Widely used in the past in things such as aerosols and refrigerators** 
- Species: **A group of organism that share the same features and can breed together to produce fertile offspring**
- Variations: **The differences between the individuals in a species**
- Inheritance: **The passing down of features from parents to offspring**
- Selective breeding: **A process of choosing individuals with desired characteristics to breed together; it is generally continued for many generations**

### Summary From The Book
- The word "atom" comes from a Greek word that means: **cannot be split**
- Atoms are made up of **protons, neutrons, and electrons**
- The nucleus of an atom is made up of **protons and neutrons**
- Electrons move around the **nucleus of an atom**
- The atomic number indicates how many protons are in the atom
- The mass number indicates how many protons + neutrons there are
- Group 1 is called **alkali metals**
- The elements in Group 1 share some properties
- The trend in Group 1 is that the melting points and the boiling points decrease, as you go down the group
- The elements in Group 1 react more vigorously with water as you go down the group.
- Group 7 is called **halogens**
- The elements in Group 7 react less vigorously as you go down the group
- Group 8 is called **noble gases**
- The elements in Group 8 have all their electrons shells full and do not react to form compounds
