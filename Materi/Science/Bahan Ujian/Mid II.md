- Proton: **Positively charged particles found inside the nucleus of an atom**.
- Positive Charge: **One type of electric charge**.
- Neutron: **Particles found in the nucleus of an atom that have no electronic charge**.
- Electron: **A negatively charged particle found surounding the nucleus of an atom**.
- Electronic Structure: **The arrangement of electrons in the shells around the nucleus of an atom**.
- Orbit: **Electronic orbits are the paths followed by electrons around the nucleus of an atom**.
- Periodic Table: **A table of all the elements**.
- Nucleus (Atom): **The centre of an atom formed from protons and neutrons**.
- Noble Gases: **The elements found in Group 8 of the Periodic Table**.
- Atomic Number: **The number of protons in an atom; each type of atom has a unique atomic number**.
- Mass Number: **The number of protons and neutrons in an atom added together**.
- Shells: **Electronic shells are layers around the nucleus of an atom where the electrons are arranged; the electrons move about within their shells**.
- Inert: **Does not react**.
- Trends In Group 1:
  - Structure: **Outer shells only have one electrons; The shell increases by one as you go down the group**.
  - Behaviour: **Reacts more vigorously with water as you go down the group**.
- Counting Proton, Neutron, and Electrons
  - Atomic number: **Number of Protons; Equal to number of Electrons**.
  - Mass number: **Protons + Neutrons**
  - Calculate Neutrons: **Mass Number - Atomic Number**
- Name of the gases in Group 8:
  - **Helium (He)**
  - **Neon (Ne)**
  - **Argon (Ar)**
  - **Krypton (Kr)**
  - **Xenon (Xe)**
  - **Radon (Rn)**
- Group 1 Elements:
  - **Lithium (Li)**
  - **Sodium (Na)**
  - **Potassium (K)**
