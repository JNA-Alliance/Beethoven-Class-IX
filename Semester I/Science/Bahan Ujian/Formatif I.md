## Question From The Book
- Where do plants get carbon dioxide from?
- Where do plants get water from?
- Why photosynthesis only takes place inside chloroplasts?
- Mineral salts that are needed by plants
- Why a plant that does not have enough Magensium will not grow well?
- How do plants absorb mineral salts from the soil?
- What is water used for in plants?
- Why a plan wilts if it is short of water?
- How does water help keep a plant cool?
- What are the difference between 'plant' and 'flower'?
- Where are the female gametes found in a flower?
- Where are the male gametes found in a flower?
- What is the name of the male gamete in humans?
- What is the name of the female gamete in humans?
- Where does fertilisation happen in humans?
- What is meant by 'seed dispersal'?
- Why seed dispersal is important for plants?
- List three ways in which fruits can help with seed dispersal.

## Core Concept
- Male Part: Smatens (which consist of Anthers and Filament).
- Female Part: Ovaries, Style, and Stigma.
- Male Gamete: Nuclei inside Pollen Grain.
- Female Gamete: Nuclei inside Ovule.
- When Male Gamete Fuses With Female Gamete: **It became a Zygote which then developes into an Embryo while the Ovary became the seed.**

## Summary From The Book
- Photosynthesis is the production of Glucose and Oxygen, by reacting water and carbon dioxide, using energy from light.
- Plants often changesome of the glucose into starch, for storage.
- Plants need nitrate to make proteins, which are neede dto make new cells for growth.
- Plants need Magnesium to create Chrolophyll.
- Flowers are the reproductive organs of plants.
- The male parts of the flower are the stamens. Pollen contains the male gametes.
- The female parts of a flower are the ovaries, style, and stigma. Ovules contain the female gamete.
- Petals have bright colors and strong scents to attract insects and birds.
- The male ametes of a flower are inside the pollen grains. The female gametes are inside the ovules.
- The male gametes cannot move by themselves, so flowers make use of insects, birds or the wind to move their pollen grains.
- The transfer of pollen from an anther to a stigma is called pollination.
- When a pollen grain has landed on a stigma, it grows a tube down to an ovule.
- The male gamete (nucleus) goes down the tube. It fuses with the female nucleus inside an ovule, producing a zygote.
- The zygote divides over and over again, and produces an embryo plant.
- The ovule becomes a seed, with the embryo plant inside it.
- Ovaries develop into fruits after fertilisation
- Fruits contain seeds
- Fruits have adaptations to help the seeds inside them disperse to new places. 
- Seed dispersal helps to avoid competition with the parent plant.
