### Sentence
**MULAI**: Today's motion is that _________. I agree with this motion and I'm going to explain why.
**ENDING**: With that said, today's motion must stand. Thank you.

### Points
- **Tuition Fees**
    Public school fees are paid by the government. This means parents does not need to pay anything to send their children to school. Some public school even provided the uniforms and books for free!
- **Curriculum**
    Curriculum is often provided by the government in public schools. And usually what is learned will come out in a national exam. So students are better prepared to face the national exam.
- **Association (_Pergaulan_)**
    Association in public school is more rich and diverse. Students come from different social, cultural and economic backgrounds. This is an advantage that private schools do not have. Because from childhood, children will learn to respond to differences and learn to accept and adapt better.
- **Facilities**
    Some public school have better facilities than the others. Since some public schools are trusted more than others. Some even have a computer lab, projector, air conditioning, and other facilities that supports teaching and learning activities.

### Critical Questions
- **Some public schools ask for money to enroll children in school**
    Yes, this is true. But this is actually against the rules imposed by the government. The one who asked for money in this case was commonly the principal of the school, and parents could actually report this to the police or publish this news to the newspaper.
- **Curriculum sucks!**
    The curriculum is often provided by the government and most private school will follow the same curriculum.
- **Classroom is dirty**
    Yes, some classroom is indeed dirty. This is aconsequences of free tuition fees. The school couldn't hire cleaners and some school even force the teachers and students to clean the school. But this activity should be considered as a good activity because they all will work together to clean up the school.
- **Incomplete facilities**
    I do admit that most public school have little to no facilities such as computer lab, science lab, etc. But we are living in a world full of technologies where most students have access to smartphones. So they could search online videos for demonstration or stuff they're interested in more.
- **Association/Relationship is too diverse**
    Yes, Association in public school is indeed more rich and diverse. Students come from different social, cultural and economic backgrounds. I believe this is an advantage that private schools do not have. Because from childhood, children will learn to respond to differences and learn to accept and adapt better.
- **People are less successful when they attend Public Schools**
    This statement is false. The success of a person does not depend on what school they attend, but rather on the person itself. If the person itself is lazy, does not have the desire to learn, then no matter what school he or she attended, that person will not be successful.
- **Class is easier at Public Schools**
    Some sources do say the same thing, but in the end, they completed the curriculum provided by the government. This means they at least understood a little about the lesson.
- **Poor teacher**
    I do agree that some teachers don't really care but I believe that there are more caring teacher than the ones who do not. If the students have the willpower to learn, they could understand the material from the book and use the Internet to find explainations on things he or she don't understand.

# Negative

**Important Points**
- Many public schools are in poor condition
- Association are too diverse
- Incomplete facilities
- Poor teacher
- Teacher:Student ratio

### Sentence
**MULAI**: Today's motion is that _________. I strongly believe this statement should fall. Let me explain why:
**ENDING**: With that said, today's motion must fall. Thank you.

### Points
- **Many Public Schools are in poor condition**
    According to sources and personal experiences, public schools often have broken ceiling, leak roof, dirty classrooms and bathrooms, broken chairs and tables, and many others. How can the students study comfortably in such conditions?
- **Incomplete Facilities**
    Facilities on public school are too basic. Often times there are no computer lab, science lab, and other learning aids. The importance of computer lab could not be neglected. We are living in a world full of technologies and we must keep up in order to survive.
- **Poor Teachers**
    While this might not always be the case, but sources says that public school teachers often don't care about how their students are doing. 
- **Teacher to Student ratio**
    Based on research, most classes in public schools contain at least 40 people. This means that for every 40 people or more, there is only 1 teacher. This will result into poor student-teacher relationship and might impact on the student's understanding of the material.

### Critical Response
- **There are public schools that are better than other public schools**
    This is true, but we can't fit everyone on that school. That's why we have lots of schools in the first place. I believe that students who attend poor condition public school will have a hard time learning comfortably.
